## Leadership and Team

### CEO and Founder: Veríssimo Cassange

Veríssimo Cassange is the founder and CEO of VerdeVive, an Angolan entrepreneur with a background in Environmental Management and a specialization in Sustainable Business from the University of Luanda. With over 10 years of experience in the sustainability sector, Veríssimo began his career in environmental NGOs before founding VerdeVive in 2023.

His vision for the company was born after identifying the growing demand for sustainable products in Angola and the lack of accessible options in the local market.
